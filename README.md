Hi, Im Esko Taivassalo

I'm most interested of making react-websites. Maybe in future it's part of my daily work ,I hope. 
Iâ€™m finishing my first coding course  tomorrow. Its name is "minustako koodari", meaning in english: could I become a coder. During this course, we have gone through the basics of java, html, javascript,css,python, etc. I got lots of education too to solve problems in code, and I found the way thinking outside of box. 
The codes in my gitHub are made with youtube-courses from different channels. It's my way just now to start writing complex code.
My way of thinking is quite simply. It's straight. If I see a problem, I work as soon as needed to solve it. Now Im trying to solve bigger problem with my app, Featsy.
I'm trying to help lonely people get friends with the power of the app.
Maybe in the future there will be an application or web page where the featsy user can simply write what they want or plan to do in their own area and other users of the application can join in doing it if they want.
