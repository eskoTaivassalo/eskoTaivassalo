Hi, Im Esko Taivassalo

Im junior developer with half year coding experience. I'm most interested of making react-websites. 
Im finished my first coding course in last month and now Im searching for new challenges. During this course, we have gone through the basics of java, html, javascript,css,python, etc. I got lots of education too to solve problems in code, and I found the way thinking outside of box. 
The codes in my gitHub are made with youtube-courses from different channels. It's my way just now to start writing code.
I increase my skills with daily projects.
