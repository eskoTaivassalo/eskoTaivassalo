Hi, Im Esko Taivassalo

I'm most interested of making react-websites. Maybe in future its part of my daily work ,I hope.
Iâ€™m finishing tomorrow my first coding course. Its name is "minustako koodari", meaning in english: Should I become as an coder. During this course I has got lots of
education in basics, as, html, javascript,css, java, python, etc. I got lots of education too to solve problems in code, and I found the way to think outside of box. 
The codes in my gitHub are made with youtube-courses from different channels. Its my way right now to start writing complex code.
My way of thinking is quite simply. Its straight. If I see a problem, I work as soon as needed to solve it. Now Im trying to solve bigger problem with my app, Featsy.
I'm trying to help lonely people get friends with the power of the app.
Via Featsy I found out coding. Its awesome!
