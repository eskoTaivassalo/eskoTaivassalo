Hi, Im Esko Taivassalo

I'm most interested of making react-websites. Maybe in future its part of my daily work ,I hope. 
Iâ€™m finishing my first coding course  tomorrow. Its name is "minustako koodari", meaning in english: could I become a coder. During this course, we have gone through the basics of java, html, javascript,css,python, etc. I got lots of education too to solve problems in code, and I found the way to think outside of box. 
The codes in my gitHub are made with youtube-courses from different channels. Its my way right now to start writing complex code.
My way of thinking is quite simply. Its straight. If I see a problem, I work as soon as needed to solve it. Now Im trying to solve bigger problem with my app, Featsy.
I'm trying to help lonely people get friends with the power of the app.
Maybe in the future there is a simple app or website where just put what is going to do, and other peoples around should join with.
